# FORKIFY
🍴 Forkify

Forkify is a sleek recipe search and bookmarking app built with modern JavaScript (ES6+), following an MVC architecture. Users can search for meals, view recipe details, adjust servings, and bookmark their favorite recipes. The app fetches real data from the Forkify API and demonstrates dynamic UI updates and API interaction using clean JavaScript without frameworks.

This project was purely done in JavaScript, without any frameworks. During implementation, I learned the most important concepts of MVC arhitecture, OOP in JS, and project planning in general.
